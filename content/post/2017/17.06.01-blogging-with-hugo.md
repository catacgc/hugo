# Why Hugo ?

My requirements when starting this blog where:

1. a preview mode and support drafts
2. good syntax highlighting
3. good theming support

There are a lot of options out-there:

- generate a site and host it somewhere, ideally free
- host the blog platform yourself (usually wordpress deployed on a hosting provider)
- use a hosted platform (wordpress.com, ghost, medium, postach.io, etc)

For me the first options was the best and, after less than 10 minutes of google searches and [2 minutes of experimenting according to the quickstart instructions](http://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/), I've settled on the Hugo + Github pages combination

Summarizing the above guide in simple script

```bash
brew install hugo
mkdir blog && cd blog

# create the site
hugo new site .

# create a post
hugo new post/welcome.md

# auto-generate and serve the blog while you are editing the post
hugo server -w --buildDrafts

```

It's that simple! Of course there are other things you can do:

- installing [a good theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-x/) from a huge variety on [themes.gohugo.io](http://themes.gohugo.io/)
- change site-wide configurations like [syntax highlight themes](TBD)

# Pushing to github pages

After you have written your first article, then it's time to share with the world. I chose GitHub pages - it's free and fairly easy to do.

First step is to go on github.com and create an empty repository called `your-username.github.io`. Note that the name of the repo must have this exact format.

Next, edit your `config.toml` file and change `baseURL = "http://your-username.github.io/"`

Now, follow these steps to push your hugo-generated site to this repo: http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/

Next, go to *http://your-username.github.io/* to see your blog.

**DONE!** You're blog is live
